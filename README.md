## Project Terminal Lyrics Play

This is a fun side project aside from the rest of the React and JavaScript projects. It displays the lyrics of the currently playing song in the terminal.

## How It Works

1. **Main Script**: The main script (`main.py`) handles fetching the lyrics of the currently playing song.
2. **Fetching Lyrics**: The script uses an API to fetch the lyrics of the song.
3. **Display**: The fetched lyrics are then displayed in the terminal.

## Setup Instructions

To get the lyrics of a particular song in the terminal, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AdibSadman192/REACT-NEXTJS-TAILWIND.git
    cd project_terminal_lyrics_play
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    or
     ```bash
    python -u main.py
    ```

4. **Additional Process**:
    1. **After running the code give song name and then artist name so that it can search that song for you**
    2. **Adjust the (sleep time) according to the song so that It can display according to the singer time to say that chorus**
     3. **You need stable internet connection (must)**

## Requirements
