# Project Terminal Lyrics Play

This is a fun side project aside from the rest of the React and JavaScript projects. It displays the lyrics of the currently playing song in the terminal.

## How It Works

1. **Main Script**: The main script (`main.py`) handles fetching the lyrics of the currently playing song.
2. **Fetching Lyrics**: The script uses an API to fetch the lyrics of the song.
3. **Display**: The fetched lyrics are then displayed in the terminal.

3. **Run the Script**:

    or
     ```bash
    python -u main.py
    ```

4. **Additional Process**:
